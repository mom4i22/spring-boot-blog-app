# spring-boot-blog-app
A web app made with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf that resembles a blog where people upload posts and comment on them.
An unregistered/unlogged user can't see anything but the posts themselves and their comments
A registered and logged user can CRUD(create, read, update and delete) posts. A guest content creator can only see, add, edit and delete his own posts 
and the comments on them while the admin user can see all posts and comments and manipulate all of them.
